# wiki-timelinee

An integration of SIMILE Timeline.js into MediaWiki for interactive timelines. This features a handy little import script, a Special Page for adding additional elements, and a bunch more.

It's all very complicated however. Do set aside some time to make this work for you because it needs it.
